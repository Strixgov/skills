# `/strix-wire` — wire Strix governance into a customer codebase

A Claude Code skill that takes a customer codebase from zero to a
kernel-evaluated mutation with a queryable, cryptographically **signed**
Strix decision in **about two minutes** — replacing the 15-minute manual
quickstart Path A.

**Local mode: zero Strix account required.** If `STRIX_API_KEY` /
`STRIX_TENANT_ID` aren't configured, the helper auto-provisions a
short-lived sandbox credential from `POST /api/public/sandbox/provision`
and proceeds — a stranger with no account still gets a real, hosted,
kernel-evaluated decision. The sandbox tenant only auto-executes this
skill's closed set of irreversible-mutation capability ids (see
strix-platform's `policy.ts` sandbox override); every other capability id
goes through real risk gating, same as a real account.

The helper's final step posts a receipt
(`POST /api/v1/decisions/{decisionId}/receipt`) that Ed25519-signs the
decision itself, so the happy path ends in a genuinely verifiable
`Status: VERIFIED` record — checkable by anyone with
`npx @strixgov/verifier@latest <decisionId>`, no Strix tooling required.
The helper also still writes the older unsigned "recorded wire evidence"
row (kernel decision + payload/result hashes under a client-generated
`evidenceId`) as a secondary audit trail, unchanged. If the receipt step
itself fails, the skill degrades honestly — it never prints a verify
command with no signed record behind it.

## What ships in this directory

```

Everything the skill needs is bundled here — **no `pip install`** (`preflight.py`
and `scanner.py` are stdlib-only).

## Requirements (what it needs to actually run)

- **Python 3** on the machine — the scanner and the Step 0 preflight guard run
  via `python3`. Stdlib only, nothing to install.
- **Network access to `https://www.strixgov.com`** — the governance itself runs
  on the hosted kernel, not locally. The wrap's final step calls
  `POST /api/public/sandbox/provision` (zero-account sandbox credential, so no
  Strix account is required), then `/api/v1/evaluate`, `/api/v1/evidence/ingest`,
  and `/api/v1/decisions/{id}/receipt` (the Ed25519 signature). If the network is
  blocked the skill **degrades honestly** — it still scans and wraps, but it
  prints the unsigned evidence id and no verify command rather than faking one.
- **Node + npm** — only for the independent check
  (`npx @strixgov/verifier@latest <id>`) and the TypeScript helper path.
- **Not bundled here:** the fully-offline `solo demo adversarial` walkthrough is
  part of the separate `solo` CLI (`pip install solo-builder-core`), not this
  skill; and the verifier is an `npx` package. Only strix-wire itself ships in
  the plugin.

## How this skill is delivered and invoked

`strix-wire` is a **loose Claude Code project skill** — it lives at
`.claude/skills/strix-wire/` inside *this* repository. In current Claude Code a
project skill's **directory name is its command**, so an agent working with
`solo-builder-core` checked out and opened in Claude Code invokes it by typing
`/strix-wire`, and it also auto-triggers when the user asks to "wire Strix" /
"add Strix to this project" / "set up governed actions" (trigger phrasing lives
in `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter `description`).

You do **not** need a separate `.claude/commands/strix-wire.md` file — a
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directory and a `.claude/commands/<name>.md`
file both register the same `/<name>` command; the skill form is just the
richer one (it can ship supporting files like `scanner.py` and `helpers/`, and
Claude can auto-invoke it). See
[Claude Code → skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md).

### `strix-wire` in the `strix-personal` plugin

The `strix-personal` **plugin** (`plugins/strix-personal/`, installed via
`/plugin install strix-personal@strix`) is a **separate, namespaced** surface.
It ships `/strix-personal:strix-scan`, `/strix-personal:strix-plan`,
`/strix-personal:strix-apply`, `/strix-personal:strix-test`,
`/strix-personal:strix-status`, a `/strix-personal:execution-control` skill,
and — as of the productization branch — a `/strix-personal:strix-wire` fast
path. That command runs the same scan → wrap → run-once → verify flow as this
skill, behind the same Step 0 fail-closed preflight: its
`scripts/strix_preflight.py` is a **byte-identical vendored copy** of this
skill's `preflight.py`, kept in lockstep by
`scripts/sync_strix_personal_plugin.py` plus a parity test.

Bare `/strix-wire` (no namespace) is available **only** as the loose project
skill in this repo; the plugin's equivalent is always namespaced
`/strix-personal:strix-wire`.

## Troubleshooting: `/strix-wire` does not appear

1. **Confirm the file exists at the exact path** `.claude/skills/strix-wire/SKILL.md`
   relative to the directory you opened in Claude Code (a project skill is
   scoped to the repo root Claude was launched in).
2. **Restart Claude Code after a fresh checkout.** A brand-new skill *directory*
   is picked up on session start; if you cloned or pulled the skill mid-session,
   restart so it registers.
3. **Type `/` and search `strix`** to confirm the skill is listed. If you see
   `/strix-personal:...` entries but no bare `/strix-wire`, you have the plugin
   installed, not this repo open — use `/strix-personal:strix-wire` (same flow),
   or open this repo in Claude Code for the bare command.
4. **You do not need to create a commands file.** If you want a bare
   `/strix-wire` in a *different* repo, copy this whole `.claude/skills/strix-wire/`
   directory (SKILL.md + `scanner.py` + `helpers/`) into that repo's
   `.claude/skills/` and restart Claude Code.

## What the skill does

1. **Detects language** — Python vs TypeScript/JavaScript, by checking
   project markers.
2. **Scans for an irreversible mutation** — payments (Stripe), DB deletes
   (Prisma, SQLAlchemy, raw SQL), S3 deletes/writes, email/SMS sends,
   filesystem deletes, schema migrations.
3. **Proposes the wrap** — shows the candidate + the diff, asks the user
   to confirm via `AskUserQuestion`.
4. **Copies the helper** — drops `governed_action.py` or `governedAction.ts`
   into the customer's source tree, mirroring their layout.
5. **Wraps the call** — rewrites the call site to go through
   `governed_action(...)` / `governedAction(...)`.
6. **Runs it once** — executes the wrapped call against Strix using the
   customer's `STRIX_API_KEY` + `STRIX_TENANT_ID` (or an auto-provisioned
   sandbox credential — local mode), then prints the unsigned
   `evidenceId`, the proof-lookup URL, and — as the final output line —
   the runnable `npx @strixgov/verifier@latest <decisionId>` command
   (INSTALL-1: the run ends with an independent check the user executes
   themselves). Because the helper's last step signs the decision via
   the receipt route, this command genuinely returns `Status: VERIFIED`
   in the happy path — it only degrades to an honest "couldn't confirm
   the signed receipt" message if that last POST itself fails.

The scanner deliberately skips test paths. Tests creating real evidence
records would pollute the customer's audit chain.

## Running the scanner directly

The scanner is also useful standalone — for a code review pass, or to
sanity-check a codebase before wiring:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/strix-wire/scanner.py --json | jq .
python3 .claude/skills/strix-wire/scanner.py --root ../other-repo
```

Exit codes: `0` (candidates found), `2` (none), `3` (bad invocation).

## The `governedAction()` contract

Both helpers implement the same contract:

0. **(Local mode only)** If no credentials are configured, POST
   `/api/public/sandbox/provision` (no auth) and use the returned
   `apiKey`/`tenantId` for every subsequent call in this run.
1. POST `/api/v1/evaluate` with `{ capabilityId, actor, context:
   { payloadHash, source } }`. Returns `allow` / `deny` / `escalate` plus
   a `decisionId`.
2. Run the caller's operation only on `allow`.
3. POST `/api/v1/evidence/ingest` with `{ records: [{ tenantId,
   capabilityId, actorId, actorRole, decision, reason, source,
   evidenceHash, evidenceId, timestamp, metadata }] }`. The response
   carries batch counters (`{ ingested, skipped, quarantined, ... }`),
   not per-record ids — the helper generates the `evidenceId` client-side
   (UUID v4), binds it into `evidenceHash`, and confirms
   `ingested + skipped >= 1` before reporting success. Unchanged from
   before local mode — still the unsigned secondary audit trail.
4. If step 1 returned a `decisionId`, POST
   `/api/v1/decisions/{decisionId}/receipt` with
   `{ success, result? }`. This Ed25519-signs the decision and returns
   `{ evidenceId (== decisionId), proofUrl }`. The helper constructs its
   own `npx @strixgov/verifier@latest <id>` string rather than trusting
   the route's own `verifyCommand` field, so the printed command is
   always `@latest`-pinned (INSTALL-1) regardless of the route's format.
   A failure here degrades gracefully: `result` and `evidenceId` (step 3)
   are still returned; `decisionId` / `signedEvidenceId` / `proofUrl` /
   `verifyCommand` are `null` instead of fabricated (PROOF-1).

The canonical-bytes contract from `solo_builder._canonical` is reproduced
inside each helper so `payloadHash` / `resultHash` / `evidenceHash`
reproduce byte-for-byte across the Python and TypeScript helpers.
Divergence breaks cross-SDK byte determinism (ADR-005 §4) — don't edit
the helpers post-copy.

## Capability-ID reference

The scanner emits one of these capability IDs per match:

| Category           | capability_id          |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| payments           | `payment.charge`       |
| db-delete          | `database.delete`      |
| db-update          | `database.update`      |
| db-create          | `database.create`      |
| s3-delete          | `storage.delete`       |
| s3-write           | `storage.write`        |
| email-send         | `email.send`           |
| sms-send           | `sms.send`             |
| file-delete        | `filesystem.delete`    |
| schema-migration   | `database.migrate`     |

These match the Strix `<artifact_type>.<action>` kernel convention
(ADR-003). The user can refine the capability later by issuing a more
specific token via `solo kernel approve`.

## Testing the helpers

```bash
pytest tests/test_strix_wire_scanner.py tests/test_strix_wire_governed_action.py
```

The scanner tests assert pattern coverage + test-path skipping. The
helper tests assert canonical bytes match the `_canonical` module
byte-for-byte, the evaluate→run→evidence sequence is correct, and denied
actions never run the operation.

## Out of scope

- **Multi-call wrapping.** One call at a time. Re-run the skill for more.
- **Async-context propagation.** Helpers take a callable; they do not
  thread custom context (request IDs, tracers).
- **Policy authoring.** Skill assumes the capability ID maps to a policy
  the Strix kernel already evaluates.
- **Pull request creation.** The skill stages a working-tree change; the
  user opens the PR.
